 **# CRUD Serverless Backend with Python, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway**

**## Overview**

This repository contains a serverless backend application that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a data model of your choice. It's built using the following technologies:

- **Python:** The programming language used for Lambda functions.
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute service for running code without provisioning or managing servers.
- **DynamoDB:** NoSQL database service for storing data.
- **API Gateway:** Service for creating, managing, and securing APIs.
- **Github Actions:** CI/CD workflow for automating builds, tests, and deployments.

**## Key Features**

- Serverless architecture for scalability and cost-efficiency.
- CRUD functionality for interacting with data.
- API Gateway for exposing RESTful endpoints.
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

**## Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
   - AWS CLI installed and configured.
   - Python 3.x installed.
   - Virtual environment (recommended).

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables:
     ```
     REGION=your-aws-region
     DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=your-dynamodb-table-name
     STAGE_NAME=your-api-gateway-stage-name
     ```

5. **Deploy the application:**
   - Use the AWS SAM CLI to deploy the application:
     ```bash
     sam build
     sam deploy --guided
     ```

**## Usage**

- Interact with the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
- Refer to the API documentation (if available) for specific endpoint details and usage examples.

**## CI/CD Workflow**

- The Github Actions workflow automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application upon pushes to the `main` branch.

**## Additional Information**

- **Data model:** Specify the model being managed by the CRUD functions.
- **API endpoints:** List the available API endpoints and their functionalities.
- **Testing:** Describe the testing strategy and any existing test cases.
- **Contributing:** Provide guidelines for contributing to the project.
